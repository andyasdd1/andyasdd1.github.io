## Project Overview

**Advisor:** Prof. Reza Rawassizadeh

Developing an integrated pipeline for extracting human motion from video and retargeting it to 3D character models for animation applications.

## Research Focus

This work explores methods for pose estimation, 3D reconstruction, and motion retargeting with focus on efficiency and accuracy.

**Key Areas:**
- Human pose estimation from video
- 3D motion reconstruction
- Character animation and motion retargeting
- Model optimization techniques

## Technical Approach

Multi-phase development combining:
- State-of-the-art pose estimation models
- Efficient fine-tuning methods
- Integration with 3D graphics pipelines
