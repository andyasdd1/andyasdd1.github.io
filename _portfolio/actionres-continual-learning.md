## Project Overview

Investigating approaches to enable machine learning systems to learn new tasks sequentially while maintaining performance on previously learned tasks.

## Research Focus

This work explores methods for continual learning in reinforcement learning settings, addressing the challenge of catastrophic forgetting when learning multiple tasks sequentially.

**Key Areas:**
- Catastrophic forgetting mitigation
- Multi-task learning
- Sequential task learning in RL

## Target Publication

**ICLR 2026** - Research in progress on continual learning methods for sequential tasks.
