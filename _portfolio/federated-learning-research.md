## Project Overview

**Advisor:** Prof. Avi Mohan

Conducting research on federated learning convergence theory through both theoretical analysis and empirical validation using object detection tasks.

## Research Focus

This work investigates how different system configurations affect convergence in federated learning settings with heterogeneous data distributions.

**Key Areas:**
- Convergence analysis in distributed learning
- Heterogeneous data handling
- Practical federated learning implementations

## Methodology

Dual-track research approach combining:
- Empirical validation on computer vision tasks
- Controlled experiments with varying data heterogeneity levels
