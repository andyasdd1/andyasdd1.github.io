## Project Overview

Exploring advanced methods for world modeling that integrate 3D scene understanding with temporal prediction capabilities using modern neural representations.

## Research Focus

This work investigates how neural representations can be used to model both spatial structure and temporal evolution of 3D scenes, with potential applications in robotics and autonomous systems.

**Key Areas:**
- Neural 3D scene representations
- Temporal dynamics modeling
- Scene reconstruction and prediction

## Target Publication

**CVPR 2026** - Research in progress on unified approaches to scene understanding and future prediction.
